Elliptic Curves over Finite Field

field element: a positive integer that is inside a modulo operation.

- cannot have a negative field element (although integers can be negative) when doing addition modulo a prime number. 
- A “negative” number in a finite field is simply the inverse of another number, that is, a number that when summed together results in zero. 
- For example, in a finite field of modulo 11, 4 can be considered “-7” because 7 + 4 (mod 11) is 0.

But what binary operator?
- addition is multiplication
- x + x = 2x = 2 * x


Elliptic curve point addition
- still works over a finite field
